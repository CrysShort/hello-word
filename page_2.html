<h1>Hello World Of Gingers</h1>
<h4>Facts About Gingers</h4>

<p> 1. Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation
Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves.</p>
<p>2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair
That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.</p>
<p>3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity
It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations.</p>
<p>4. Lucky redhead women have more sex
That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too.</p>
<p>5. It's a ballache to dye red hair
Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!</p>
